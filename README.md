# Pose2Sim Blender

**`Pose2Sim_Blender` is a Blender add-on for visualizing [Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim) results, and rigging your character with markerless kinematics.**

> ***New:***
> - .trc import: **Automatic Blender IK for character animation**
> - Faster .mot import
> - Fixed various issues

[Pose2Sim](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim) is an open-source pipeline for obtaining research-grade 3D motion analysis from consumer-grade cameras (**such as phones, webcams, GoPros, etc**). Its main application fields are sports science, biomechanics, and animation. 

This add-on can be used to visualize:
- Camera calibration (from a `.toml` file)
- Markers (from a `.trc` or `.c3d` file)
- **OpenSim** data (such as `.osim` models, `.mot` motions, and `.mot` forces)
- And much more...

Note: It can also be used to rig a character from imported markers.

[OpenSim](https://simtk.org/projects/opensim) is an open-source software for research in biomechanics, widely used in motion capture (MoCap).\
[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is an open-source software used for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering.

<br>

### Full install

> Only needed for importing `.mot` motion files.

Full installation requires admin rights on your computer. It is a little tricky, but the following steps should do it smoothly. If you encounter any issues, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/davidpagnon/Pose2Sim_Blender/issues). Only Windows has been tested, but feel free to tell me how it goes on other platforms!

##### 1. Prerequisites

  - Install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) (tested on v 3.6, 4.0, 4.2, and 5.0)
  - Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
  - Download [Pose2Sim_Blender.zip](https://github.com/sakagawa-star/Pose2Sim_Blender/raw/refs/heads/fix/coordinate-transform-rotation-bug/Pose2Sim_Blender.zip)

##### 2. Find your Blender Python version

&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Blender, press Shift+F4, type the following lines:
  
  ```python
  import sys
  sys.version
  ```
  
##### 3. Install Pose2Sim_Blender libraries
  
  - Open Miniconda, and copy-paste these lines.\
  *Replace with the Python version you just found*:
    ```cmd
    conda create -n Pose2Sim_Blender python=3.11.7 -y # python=3.10.13 with Blender 3.6 and 4.0
    conda activate Pose2Sim_Blender
    conda install -c opensim-org opensim -y
    conda list | grep opensim
    ```
    The Numpy version is likely too recent for OpenSim. The version you should install is provided in the last printed line. For example, with `py311np123` you need to run:
    ```
    pip uninstall numpy -y
    pip install numpy==1.23 
    pip install bpy toml vtk anytree
    ```
  - OpenSim installation needs to be fixed. Run the following command and write down the location of your Pose2Sim_Blender environment (typically `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\miniconda3\envs\Pose2Sim_Blender`):
    ```cmd
    conda env list
    ```
    Open *<LOCATION_OF_POSE2SIM_BLENDER_ENV>\Lib\opensim\\_\_init\_\_.py* with any text editor:
    - comment out the line `# from .moco import *`
    - line 4, insert the path to your OpenSim bin folder: `os.add_dll_directory(r"C:/OpenSim 4.5/bin")`.\
      *Replace 4.5 with the version you installed*

##### 4. Link your conda environment to Blender Python

  &nbsp;&nbsp;Open CMD (not Anaconda!) as an administrator.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;*Replace with your Blender version and with the location of your Pose2Sim_Blender environment*:
  ```cmd
  cd "C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 5.0\5.0"
  mv python python_old
  mklink /j python <LOCATION_OF_POSE2SIM_BLENDER_ENV>
  mv python\DLLs python\DLLs_old
  mklink /j python\DLLs python_old\DLLs
  mklink /j python\bin python_old\bin
  ```
  &nbsp;&nbsp;**Now, any package you install in your conda environment will immediately be available in Blender.**



<!-- #### If you need the last OpenSim beta version
- Replace the conda install line by  
`conda install https://anaconda.org/opensim-org/opensim/4.5/download/win-64/opensim-4.5-py310np121.tar.bz2 -y`
- Line 17 (instead of 4), `add os.add_dll_directory(r"C:/OpenSim 4.5/bin")`
- You may also need to install [OpenSim 4.5 beta](https://simtk.org/frs/?group_id=91#:~:text=OpenSim%20Release%20Betas) first, and to change its path from something like `C:/OpenSim 4.5-2023-12-04-cfbf426` to `C:/OpenSim 4.5`. -->

<!-- If you want to install an additional package from Blender
- Copy the bin directory from python_old to python
- https://blenderartists.org/t/can-i-install-pandas-or-other-modules-into-blenders-python/1375122
    import sys, subprocess, os
    python_exe = os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'bin', 'python.exe') # remove '.exe' on Linux
    subprocess.call([python_exe, "-m", "pip", "install", "pandas"])
-->

##### 5. Install Pose2Sim_Blender add-on in Blender
  
  - Blender -> Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> `little arrow on the upper right corner` -> Install from Disk -> Find your Pose2Sim_Blender.zip file
  - Check `Pose2Sim_Blender` to enable it
  - Press `n` or Click on the tiny arrow on the upper-right corner of the 3D viewport to open the tool

<br>


## Demonstration

Find example files in the `Examples` folder of your [Pose2Sim_Blender.zip](https://github.com/sakagawa-star/Pose2Sim_Blender/raw/refs/heads/fix/coordinate-transform-rotation-bug/Pose2Sim_Blender.zip) archive.

### Camera tools

- **Import:**\
  Import a `.toml` calibration file from Pose2Sim.
- **Export:**\
  Export updated cameras as a `.toml` calibration file.
- **Show:**\
  Import videos, image sequences, or still images in your camera frame of reference. The image plane is automatically scaled when translated.
- **Film:**\
  Render view from all or selected cameras, as a movie or an image sequence. Choose your framerate, the first and last frame to be rendered, and the output quality.

### OpenSim imports

- **Import Markers**:\
  Import a `.trc` or a `.c3d` marker file, e.g., generated by Pose2Sim triangulation.\
  ***New:*** You can now choose the type of skeleton to be created in order to rig your character from the markers (c3d rig not supported yet).\
  ***N.B.:** Make sure you entered the right `Target framerate` (upper right corner).*
- **Import Model**:\
  Import the "bodies" of an `.osim` model. \
  *If you did the [full install](#full-install) and some Geometry files exist only as .vtp, they will automatically be converted to .stl.*
- **Import Motion**:\
  Import a `.mot` or a `.csv` motion file. ***N.B.:** Make sure you entered the right `Target framerate`  (upper right corner).*
  - *If you did the [full install](#full-install), you can import a `.mot` file. Calculating all body segment positions may take a while if the model is complex or if there are many time frames. Creates a .csv file for faster loading next time.*
  - *If not, you will have to [install the OpenSim API](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Conda+Package) outside of Blender and use [bodykin_from_mot_osim.py](https://github.com/perfanalytics/pose2sim/blob/main/Pose2Sim/Utilities/bodykin_from_mot_osim.py) to convert it to .csv.*
- **Import Forces**:\
  Import a `.mot` GRF force file.\
  ***N.B.:** Make sure you entered the right `Target framerate` (upper right corner).*

### Other tools

- **3D point motion path:**\
  Visualize the motion path of one or several selected 3D points.
- **See through cameras:**\
  View from selected camera, with markers and OpenSim model overlay.
- **Rays from 3D point:**\
  Trace rays from one or several selected 3D points. *This can help you verify if a triangulated point correctly meets 2D keypoints on image planes.*
- **Ray from image point:**\
  ***Coming soon!*** Trace ray from a point selected on an image plane. *This can help you see if rays intersect correctly.* 
- **Export to Alembic:**\
  Export to an `.abc` Alembic "baked" file, for fast import into other softwares.
